gentoo-overlay
==============

Overlay for Gentoo/Linux packages

The following packages are available in this overlay:

Easy-Ebook-Viewer - https://github.com/michaldaniel/Ebook-Viewer

## Warning - This is by no means an official overlay, just something I did in my free time

**Use ebuilds supplied in this repository on your own risk**. They've been tested on my own system setup (~amd64) and (most likely) tested on virtual systems (amd64 and x86).

## Installing

Create a local overlay (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Overlay/Local_overlay) and copy the files of this repo into it. After that you just have to emerge easy-ebook-viewer
