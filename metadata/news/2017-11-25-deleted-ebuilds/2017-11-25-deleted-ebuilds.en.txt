Multiple ebuilds were moved to the https://github.com/csmk/frabjous overlay, including:

dev-python/validictory

dev-python/pycryptodomex

dev-python/gpsoauth

dev-python/gmusicapi

dev-vcs/gitkraken

media-sound/gmusicproxy

net-im/rambox-bin

You may want to switch to using the frabjous overlay for these packages, to ensure that
you'll be getting timely ( or any ) updates.
